This code uses the os library to determine the path to the desktop (desktop_path). Then, it creates the path to the file on the desktop (file_path) by combining desktop_path with the filename ('numbers.txt'). All numbers are written to this file. After the program finishes execution, a message is printed indicating that the numbers have been written to "numbers.txt" on the desktop.
